promise rejections due to\n * things like awaiting Request data like `headers()`. The rejections are fine and should\n * not be construed as problematic so we need to avoid the appearance of a problem by\n * omitting them from the logged output.\n *\n * THE STRATEGY:\n * 1. Install a filtering unhandled rejection handler\n * 2. Intercept process event methods to capture new handlers in our internal queue\n * 3. For each rejection, check if it comes from an aborted prerender context\n * 4. If yes, suppress it. If no, delegate to all handlers in our queue\n * 5. This provides precise filtering without time-based windows\n *\n * This ensures we suppress noisy prerender-related rejections while preserving\n * normal error logging for genuine unhandled rejections.\n */\n\nimport { workUnitAsyncStorage } from '../app-render/work-unit-async-storage.external'\n\nconst MODE:\n  | 'enabled'\n  | 'debug'\n  | 'silent'\n  | 'true'\n  | 'false'\n  | '1'\n  | '0'\n  | ''\n  | string\n  | undefined = process.env.NEXT_UNHANDLED_REJECTION_FILTER\n\nlet ENABLE_UHR_FILTER = true\nlet UHR_FILTER_LOG_LEVEL: 'debug' | 'warn' | 'silent' = 'warn'\n\nswitch (MODE) {\n  case 'silent':\n    UHR_FILTER_LOG_LEVEL = 'silent'\n    break\n  case 'debug':\n    UHR_FILTER_LOG_LEVEL = 'debug'\n    break\n  case 'false':\n  case 'disabled':\n  case '0':\n    ENABLE_UHR_FILTER = false\n    break\n  case '':\n  case undefined:\n  case 'enabled':\n  case 'true':\n  case '1':\n    break\n  default:\n    if (typeof MODE === 'string') {\n      console.error(\n        `NEXT_UNHANDLED_REJECTION_FILTER has an unrecognized value: ${JSON.stringify(MODE)}.
